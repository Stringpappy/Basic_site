The structure of the folders mentioned suggests a project likely related to web development. Here's the purpose of each folder:

1. API
Purpose: Contains code for the application's API (Application Programming Interface).
Role:
Manages how the backend communicates with external clients or frontend components.
Implements endpoints that allow clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations or interact with the application's resources.
Example Contents:
RESTful API code (using Flask, FastAPI, or similar frameworks).
Authentication/authorization logic.
JSON response handlers.
2. web_static
Purpose: Stores static assets for the web application.
Role:
Provides content that does not change dynamically, such as images, CSS, JavaScript, and static HTML files.
Ensures these resources are easily accessible for rendering the frontend.
Example Contents:
styles.css (CSS for styling).
script.js (client-side JavaScript).
Images or icons used on the site.
3. web_flask
Purpose: Contains Flask-based web application logic.
Role:
Manages routes, templates, and dynamic rendering of the web application.
Acts as the glue between the API/backend logic and the frontend.
Example Contents:
Route definitions (app.py, routes.py).
Jinja2 templates for dynamic HTML rendering.
Middleware or custom filters.
4. tests
Purpose: Houses unit, integration, or end-to-end test scripts.
Role:
Ensures the application behaves as expected under various conditions.
Contains automated test cases to validate API endpoints, backend logic, or frontend behavior.
Example Contents:
Test scripts using unittest, pytest, or other frameworks.
Mock data for testing.
Coverage reports and setup files for CI/CD pipelines.
General Workflow with This Structure:
Develop API in the API folder.
Build and style the frontend using assets from web_static.
Integrate backend and frontend using Flask routes and dynamic templates in web_flask.
Test and validate functionality in the tests folder.
This modular structure keeps the project organized and scalable, making it easier for different teams (e.g., frontend, backend, QA) to work collaboratively.
